            <p>
              For most organisations, third parties play a fundamental role in enabling them to operate effectively and achieve their objectives; consequently, they can present their clients with a broad range of potentially significant risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              From successful strategic execution with joint venture partners, to operational disruption should a key supplier fail, as well as the legal and reputational risks associated with third parties representing you in the market place, your organisation's success and brand equity can be critically dependent on your third party ecosystem. Coupled with the ever increasing reliance being placed on supply chains across numerous industry sectors, procurement and supply chain management done well can be a fundamental source of competitive advantage and enhance organisational impact. As a result, the 'extended enterprise', and its careful, proactive and ongoing management by the organisation, is now firmly in focus for executive teams, boards and regulators alike.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to the size of third party networks, which can consist of tens of thousands of entities for some organisations, as well as the breadth of risk exposures such networks face, we recognise management is no easy task. The way we support our clients is therefore based on pragmatic solutions to address these realties, deploying risk profiling and evaluation techniques to validate which third parties the organisation has key dependencies on and vulnerabilities to, and associated risk exposures. We then develop appropriate risk response strategies in order to prevent and mitigate potential value loss caused by third party performance issues, deployed throughout the third party management lifecycle, including initial procurement and due diligence, ongoing performance / S&OP management, monitoring and audit, as well as termination and exit management. The emergence of AI capabilities within supply chain management has further opened a whole suite of opportunities for real time risk analysis and surveillance across multiple supplier tiers, as well as more robust and accurate supply and demand forecasting potential.
